								<p> As an individual who has personally experienced Covid-19 and is keenly interested in healthcare, 
									I became intrigued by delving into the data surrounding one of the most significant pandemics of our time:
									 Coronavirus. Considering the profound impact of this pandemic on everyone's lives, I was driven to seek 
									 answers to the questions that arose within me.</p>
								<p> The objectives that I aimed to address through my project are: <br />
									• Uncover valuable insights into the impact of Covid-19 in the United States, which entails examining infection rate trends over time, determining the percentage of the population affected by Covid-19, and identifying states with the highest number of Covid-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic.
										<br />
									• Identify demographics at higher risk of Covid-19, including the age group most significantly affected by the virus and racial groups exhibiting higher infection rates. Additionally, the project aims to create geographical maps showcasing the distribution of Covid-19 cases across the United States, enabling the identification of regions with elevated infection rates.
										<br />
									• Explore the correlation between a state's population size and its Covid-19 case count, analyzing this relationship to gain insights into the role of population density and its influence on the virus's spread at the state level. 
									 	<br />
								</p>
								<p> In this project, I present my approach to addressing these key questions, which involves gathering and cleaning
									 data using SQL, employing Tableau for data visualization, and utilizing supervised machine learning techniques 
									 like linear regression to unveil insights about Coronavirus in the United States.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/legacy/sites/kuar/files/201311/ClintonAirport.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>The main aim of this project is to develop a specialized Power BI Dashboard that effectively analyzes and extracts valuable insights from airline data related to the Bill & Hillary Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, AR from October 2022 to March 2023. The project focuses on utilizing the capabilities of Power BI to provide comprehensive and detailed information about the airport's airline operations, specifically focusing on four major airlines: American Airlines, Inc., Delta Airlines Inc, Frontier Airlines Inc, and Southwest Airlines Co.</p>

										<p>
											• Develop a Power BI Dashboard that analyzes airline data for the specified airport and time period, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights into airline operations and performance.<br />
											• Focus on four major airlines and examine key performance metrics, including flight volumes, arrival and departure delays, cancellations, and popular destinations.<br />
											• Provide a comprehensive view of the airline ecosystem in the specified region and identify trends and patterns that can inform data-driven decision-making for airlines and airport management.<br />

									<p>
										The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) is a collaborative partnership striving to improve economic and community growth across eight states: Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. Each year, the Delta Leadership Institute hosts an event for DRA leaders from these states to assess their progress and efforts over the previous years. The goal of this project was to provide an overview of the 8-state Delta Region, focusing on highlighting regional differences.
									</p>
								
									<p>
										As part of the data analytics intern team, our primary objectives were to: <br />
											• Create accessible and interactive dashboard reports. I was responsible for developing the Economic Indicators Dashboard, which included Business Applications, Poverty, and Employment. <br />
											• Present key findings for each topical area. <br />
											• Develop a narrative to engage community stakeholders regarding the issues and progress in these regions.<br />
											
										</p>
										</ul>
									</p>
								
									<p>
										Our approach involved using Excel and Tableau for data collection, analysis, visualization, and presenting our findings. Throughout the project, we collaborated closely with Eric Atchison, the Vice President of Strategic Research for Arkansas State University Systems, who offered valuable insights and guidance.

										<h2><a href="#">Arkansas Hate Crime<br />
										Data Science Project</a></h2>
										<h6>[Python]</h6>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> This data analyst project explores hate crime incidents in Arkansas, where nearly 1,000 hate crimes have occurred. The project analyzes a dataset with 226,328 data points and 28 variables. Using Jupyter Notebook, I cleaned and visualized the data, identifying key factors contributing to these hate crimes. To gain insights, I employed advanced Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting using sci-kit learn.</p>
